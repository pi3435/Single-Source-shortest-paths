# Single-Source-shortest-paths
Include Bellman-ford algorithm and Dijkstra algorithm
In my opinon, the core of Bellman-ford algorithm is the maxmum num of edges in the shortest path is |G.V|-1. The core of Dijstra algorithm, just like climb the mountain, we only find the highest point currently. It is a greedy algorithm.
